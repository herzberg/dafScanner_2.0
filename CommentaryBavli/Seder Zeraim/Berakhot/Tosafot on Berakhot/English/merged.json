                "Verses twice and translation (Targum, i.e. Aramaic translation) once - Some explain that the requirement [of reading a translation] applies to foreigners in their (native) language, as it is like (Aramaic) Targum that sometimes explains the verses. Because, just as the (Aramaic) Targum explains [the verses] to the Amei Ha'aretz (literally, \"People of the Land\"), so too, foreigners understand [the translation of the verses] through their native tongue. However, this does not appear [to be a correct], since the (Aramaic) Targum explains items that cannot be understood from the Hebrew, as can be found in many places. [For example], Rabbi Yosef said, (Megillah 3a) \"If it were not for the (Aramaic) Targum of this verse, I would not know what it is speaking of.\" Therefore, one should not recite [the translation] in any language the third time (i.e. after the verses are read in Hebrew twice), except for the language of the (Aramaic) Targum."
