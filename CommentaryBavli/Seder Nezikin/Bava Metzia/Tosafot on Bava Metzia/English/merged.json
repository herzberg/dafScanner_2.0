                "The Gemara uses this particular language because of Bat Sheva was a doubtfully married woman. Rashi interpreted that it is because ever man who went to one of David’s wars signed a Gett, on the condition that if he dies, she will be expelled and she would not require יבום (divorce), and all of the days he is out at war she would be considered doubtfully married. And this is a difficulty for Rabeinu Tam that if this is so, it is not “all men”, it is only if they had brothers and did not have children. However, Rashi is not particular when he says “יבום”, rather she will not be tied down (become an Agunah)."
