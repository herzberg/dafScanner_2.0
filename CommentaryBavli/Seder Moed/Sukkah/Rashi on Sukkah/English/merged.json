But ritual impurity that is confined, where there is not a tefah of space to the roof against it, the ritual impurity breaks through and ascends to the heavens. And indeed, this is a law given to Moshe from Sinai. It follows that a house that contains a corpse or a kezayit of a corpse, and he filled it with straw or stones and nullified them. [The sources of ritual impurity] are confined and break through. But if he did not nullify them, then it is as if he removed them, and there is a space."

The Tanna Kamma says that they require verbal nullification. And Rabbi Yose said to him: \"If he knows that he will not remove it, then it is considered nullified from there. And stones, even placed simply, when he does not know if he will remove them or not, it is considered nullified. Unless he knows that he will remove it; then it is like straw placed simply, and it is not nullified.\" It follows that if straw or earth are nullified verbally, then everybody agrees that they are considered nullified. If straw is placed without intention, or earth is placed with intention to remove it, then it is not nullified according to everybody. On straw that he will not remove, and earth of similar nature, or even earth without any intention, it is a disagreement, and Rabbi Yose considers them to be nullified."
