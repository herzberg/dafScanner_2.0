            Thanks to Dr. Robert Kirsch who figured out how to install
            the drivers for Windows WordPerfect.   It's very simple.

                1. Add the TrueType fonts (read Windows manual if you
                   aren't sure how).

                2. Bring up WordPerfect for Windows and update the
                   printer driver.

                3. Exit back out to DOS and follow the instructions
                   for installing the keyboard drivers listed above.
