                                 THANK YOU!

For using the latest KESHERworks products:




WIN_HEB.COM
KEYBOARD.DRV
WINSTART.BAT

        These are the files required for Hebrew text entry under
        Windows 3.x.  Installation is a manual process.

        1.  Copy WIN_HEB.COM and WINSTART.BAT to your Windows directory
            (usually C:\WINDOWS).  

        2.  Copy KEYBOARD.DRV to your Windows system directory
            (usually C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM)

        3.  Run Windows.  Select the Hebrew font you want, and activate
            it by pressing the NUM LOCK key.  Enjoy!

                    This software is NOT free, but SHAREWARE.  The registration
            fee is $54 for all the fonts AND the drivers.  At that, it
            is a cheap price for true Hebrew capability for your
            PC.  This will also entitle you to a update notice
            on any new releases.

            Load the MENDEL SIDDUR font and print out HEB-WIN.WRI from
            Windows WRITE to get a keyboard mapping.  We also have some
            excellent quality (but not cheap!) keycap labels for $22!
            I have had mine installed for 2 years with no problems!

            Also we have English/Hebrew keyboards and CGA/Monochrome
            chips.
