and on this yesoid that everyone has the zelba zchusim.  
We're holding by a geferliche machloikes being machria 
if this medina, or an andere medina made in the same 
oifen and with the same machshovos, can have a kiyum.  
We are all mitztaref on the daled amos where a chalois 
of that machloikes happened in order to be mechabed 
the soldiers who dinged zich with each other.  We are

kever for the bekavodike soldiers who were moiser 
nefesh and were niftar to give a chiyus to our nation.  
Yashrus is mechayev us to do this... Lemaise, hagam 
the velt won't be goires or machshiv what we speak 
out here, it's zicher not shayach for them to forget 
what they tued uf here. We are mechuyav to be meshabed 
ourselves to the melocha in which these soldiers made 
a haschala--that vibalt they were moiser nefesh for 
this eisek, we must be mamash torud in it--that we
